                <p>
                    My name is Mohammed-Minhajur Rahman, and I am currently working as a project coordinator at the NBN.
                    While my background is in engineering and project management, my exposure to coding was limited to
                    my flexible first year
                    at
                    university, where I had to take some coding units. Unfortunately, at that time, I didn't enjoy
                    coding
                    and ended up dropping all the related units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, recognizing the increasing significance of technology in the modern world, I decided to
                    face my
                    fear of coding and ensure long-term sustainability in my career. I believe that the technology
                    industry
                    offers endless opportunities, and I want to be a part of it. That's why I enrolled in a coding
                    bootcamp
                    to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since starting the bootcamp, I have delved into the world of coding, specifically focusing on HTML
                    and
                    CSS. It has been an exciting journey so far, and I am eager to explore what lies ahead. I am
                    motivated
                    to develop my coding abilities and become proficient in various programming languages and
                    frameworks.

                    My goal is to leverage my project coordination experience and combine it with my newfound coding
                    skills
                    to contribute effectively to the technology industry. I am passionate about staying up to date with
                    the
                    latest technological advancements and using them to create innovative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this bootcamp, I aim to overcome my previous aversion to coding and embrace it as a powerful
                    tool for problem-solving and creativity. I am committed to continuously learning and improving my
                    skills, as I believe that coding is an essential skill for the future.
